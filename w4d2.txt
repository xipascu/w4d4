GET /login 
select * from users

get a list of all urls for users
GET /urls
/urls
-id in a cookie can be used to query the id from urls
SELECT * FROM urls WHERE userid= 'givenid'
select short, long from urls where user_id = 1

///create a url when you're in the user
POST /urls INSERT INTO urls (short, long, user_id)
VALUES ('abc'. 'http...ask.com', givenID)

//retrieving single url to be able to modify
GET /urls/:short
SELECT short,longFROM urls WHERE short = 'abc'

//editing a short url
POST /urls/:short/edit
UPDATE urls SET long = 'http...ask.com'
WHERE short = 'abc'

//remove the url 
POST /urls/:short/delete
DELETE FROM urls WHERE short = 'abc';


//PUT has a body, delete doesn't 
  -delete: pass through paramater or query string
  -both are idempotent, calling the 1st time will make 
    a change on the server, but the second time it won't make a dif
  -post, when called, is assuming a change will happen on
    server each time

_______________________
Executing queries asynchronously

await: function inside needs to be async
  client.query: returns a promise: a way to deal with async programming
await will stop executing a function until a promise comes back
when it's returned it will pass value and assign it to a variable

const using = require('modules') 


body parser takes a url encoded string  key=value&key-value 
and passes it on as json to the body
  -started way that forms submit data

seed file : stores data

middleware: grabs list of users from database
and adds that array of users and assigns it to the locals

locals: locals will be set in the locals variable on every request
-used as a template across every request

properties in it
